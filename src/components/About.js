          Trader and Fullstack Web3 developer specialising in Security who is passionate about learning the latest technologies
          that can make an impact, and solving problems - being the reason why I have carried over my
          tech sales & frontend experience with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, to the blockchain world.

        <p className='extra -> info about self'>
          Born in Spain and lived there for 11 years (and yes I can speak Spanish fluently xD).
          Currently residing in London, UK.

        <p className='mid -> what I did'>
          Graduated from the University of Northampton as part of Class of 2020 with a 2:1 degree
          in Computing (Graphics and Visualisation). Prior to university, I learned Photoshop, which I began to leverage for myself, as I was a DJ 2 years deep in the game, and freelancing.
          From the start of my uni journey, I used Javascript for almost all my modules.
          During my second year of uni, I began to explore the world of tech, as I wanted to learn about the trending tools and approaches, as we were only taught the OG technologies like Java.
          During this time, I had included web development and visual design to my offerings, which saw me produce a wide range of assets for small businesses and events.
          In my third and final year, I continued exploring further, leading me to find about VueJS (the first ever JS framework I touched), ReactJs, GraphQL, and more.
          In the midst of the pandemic, when I wasn't working on my PWA-themed dissertation, I would search for tutorials on YouTube to learn about these technologies.
          Once I completed my studies, I focused on testing myself and putting my knowledge to action, which saw me creating several web apps with the tools I had learned.

          <br />
          <br />
          After this, I began to explore Blockchain development in depth. I started to
          learn about the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity, and I was able to build small projects
          with it. Once I was confident, another lockdown striked again, and I realised that it would
          be a great opportunity to learn more about the business side of the tech industry, so that I could leverage it for my own projects in this new paradigm.
          This is the reason why I took on a part-time role as a Sales Development Representative at EG, a Gartner-related
          tech sales provider - briefly, the role consisted of cold-calling* prospects and conducting lead-generation for our
          startup-to-sizeable clients, building and establishing genuine relationships for them, and formulating new outreach strategies.

          <span className="text-xs italic">
            *Not really cold-calling though, just a casual chat to personally get to know the decision-making individuals and the company, and see
            whether our clients' solutions would fit their needs.
          </span>
        </p>

          Having had some experience developing on the Ethereum blockchain, I'm currently hacking my way
          towards specialising in the security and privacy of smart contracts.
        </p>
        <p className="outro -> what I'm doing">
          By leveraging the power of blockchain, I'm working on two exciting DAO projects that I plan
          to roll out *very* soon; one changes the DAO game completely, while the other taps into a
          humongous emerging market.
